## Introduction
This repository serves as an information site for the framework named HydroSuite - A collection of open source software developed using web technologies tailoring hydrological and environmental domain. For more information, the reader should explore the list of repositories below.

## Description of HydroSuite
HydroSuite is a compilation of open-source software that encompasses a broad range of topics within the hydrological and environmental domains. These topics include:

* Data
* Computing
* Visualization, Mapping, and Digital Twin Systems
* Community portals

The projects within HydroSuite have been developed using state-of-the-art web technologies designed to foster better integration between client and server-side resources. This highly data and modeling-driven concept facilitates collaboration among diverse entities for the development of new tools and libraries. Furthermore, it expands existing semantics to create a more robust and highly scalable product. HydroSuite is an integral part of a larger ecosystem that incorporates various open-source tools for education, research, and operational purposes.
